# Value Investing 101 - Complete Beginner Guide

## What is Value Investing?

Value investing is finding **good companies selling at cheap prices**.

Imagine buying a $100 bill for $70. That's value investing with stocks.

**The core idea:** Every company has an "intrinsic value" (what it's actually worth). Sometimes the stock market prices a company below its true value. Value investors find these bargains and buy them.

**Famous value investors:** Warren Buffett, Benjamin Graham, Charlie Munger

## The 5 Things Value Investors Care About

### 1. VALUATION - "Is it cheap?"
Is the stock price low compared to what the company earns/owns?

### 2. QUALITY - "Is it a good business?"
Does the company make money efficiently? Is it well-managed?

### 3. GROWTH - "Is it getting bigger?"
Are revenues and profits increasing over time?

### 4. DIVIDENDS - "Does it pay me while I wait?"
Does the company share profits with shareholders?

### 5. MOAT - "Can competitors kill it?"
Does the company have lasting advantages that protect it?

## Every Metric Explained (Why It Matters)

### VALUATION METRICS

| Metric | What It Means | Good Value | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **P/E Ratio** (Price-to-Earnings) | Stock price divided by earnings per share | < 15 | Lower = cheaper. A P/E of 10 means you pay $10 for every $1 of earnings. |
| **P/B Ratio** (Price-to-Book) | Stock price divided by book value per share | < 1.5 | Lower = cheaper. Below 1.0 means stock costs less than company's net assets. |
| **EV/EBITDA** | Enterprise value divided by operating earnings | < 10 | Lower = cheaper. Accounts for debt, better than P/E for comparing companies. |
| **P/FCF** (Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow) | Stock price divided by free cash flow | < 15 | Lower = cheaper. Free cash flow is real money the company generates. |

**Plain English:** If P/E is 10, you're paying $10 to "own" $1 of annual profit. If P/E is 30, you're paying $30 for that same $1. Lower is better (usually).

### QUALITY METRICS

| Metric | What It Means | Good Value | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **ROE** (Return on Equity) | Profit divided by shareholder equity | > 15% | Higher = better. Shows how well company uses your money to make profit. |
| **ROIC** (Return on Invested Capital) | Profit divided by all invested capital | > 12% | Higher = better. Buffett's favorite metric. Shows true business efficiency. |
| **Gross Margin** | (Revenue - Cost of Goods) / Revenue | > 30% | Higher = better. High margins mean pricing power and efficiency. |
| **Net Margin** | Net Profit / Revenue | > 10% | Higher = better. What percentage of sales becomes actual profit. |
| **Debt/Equity** | Total debt divided by shareholder equity | < 0.5 | Lower = safer. High debt is risky - company could go bankrupt. |
| **Current Ratio** | Current assets / Current liabilities | > 1.5 | Higher = safer. Can the company pay its short-term bills? |

**Plain English:** ROE of 20% means for every $100 shareholders invested, the company makes $20 profit per year. That's good. ROE of 5% means only $5 profit - that's weak.

### GROWTH METRICS

| Metric | What It Means | Good Value | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **Revenue Growth (1yr)** | This year's revenue vs last year | > 5% | Higher = growing. Company is selling more. |
| **Revenue Growth (5yr)** | Compound annual growth over 5 years | > 7% | Higher = consistent growth. Not just a one-time spike. |
| **EPS Growth (5yr)** | Earnings per share growth over 5 years | > 8% | Higher = better. Profits growing faster than just revenue is ideal. |
| **FCF Growth** | Free cash flow growth | > 5% | Higher = better. Real cash generation is increasing. |

**Plain English:** A company growing revenue at 15%/year doubles in size every 5 years. One growing at 3%/year barely keeps up with inflation.

---

### DIVIDEND METRICS

| Metric | What It Means | Good Value | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **Dividend Yield** | Annual dividend / Stock price | 2-5% | Higher = more income. But too high (>8%) might be unsustainable. |
| **Payout Ratio** | Dividends / Earnings | 30-60% | Middle is best. Too high = risky, too low = stingy. |
| **Dividend Growth (5yr)** | How fast dividends increase | > 5% | Higher = better. Growing dividends beat inflation. |
| **Years of Dividend Growth** | Consecutive years of increases | > 10 | Higher = reliable. "Dividend Aristocrats" have 25+ years. |

**Plain English:** 3% dividend yield means if you invest $10,000, you get $300/year in cash payments while you hold the stock.

---

### SAFETY/MOAT METRICS

| Metric | What It Means | Good Value | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **Beta** | Stock volatility vs market | 0.5-1.2 | Lower = less volatile. High beta = wild price swings. |
| **Market Cap** | Total company value | > $10B | Larger = more stable. Small caps are riskier but can grow more. |
| **ROIC Consistency** | Stable ROIC over 5+ years | Low variation | Consistent = durable moat. Competitors can't easily steal profits. |

**Plain English:** A company with ROIC consistently above 15% for 10 years probably has something special protecting it (brand, patents, network effects).

## Value Investing Red Flags (What to Avoid)

| Red Flag | Why It's Bad |
|----------|--------------|
| P/E > 30 | Overpriced - paying too much for earnings |
| Debt/Equity > 2 | Dangerous - too much debt |
| Negative ROE | Losing money - not profitable |
| Dividend Yield > 10% | Likely unsustainable - dividend might be cut |
| Revenue declining | Shrinking business |
| Negative Free Cash Flow | Burning cash - might need to raise money |
