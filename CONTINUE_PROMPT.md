## Project: US Value Investing Dashboard

I'm building a Bloomberg Terminal-style value investing dashboard for US stocks. I'm a beginner developer with no value investing knowledge - please be the domain expert and guide me.

### Project Location
```
/home/amee/ValueInvest/
```

### What's Been Done

1. **Specifications Complete:**
   - `docs/MASTER_SPECIFICATION.md` - Overall system design (v2.0)
   - `docs/stage1_preliminary_screening_spec.md` - Stock screening
   - `docs/stage2_detailed_scoring_spec.md` - Scoring system
   - `docs/stage3_deep_analysis_spec.md` - DCF + 10-K analysis
   - `docs/stage4_dashboard_ui_spec.md` - Interactive dashboard UI spec

2. **Looker Studio Prototype Ready:**
   - `dashboard/looker-studio/VALUE_INVESTING_101.md` - Complete value investing guide for beginners (explains every metric)
   - `dashboard/looker-studio/STEP_BY_STEP_TUTORIAL.md` - Click-by-click Looker Studio instructions
   - `dashboard/looker-studio/SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Technical setup reference
   - `dashboard/looker-studio/sample_stock_data.csv` - 40 sample stocks ready to import

### Where I Left Off

I have all the files ready to build the Looker Studio prototype:
- Sample data CSV with 40 stocks
- Step-by-step tutorial with exact clicks
- Value investing guide explaining what each metric means

### What I Need To Do Next

**If I haven't built the Looker Studio dashboard yet:**
1. Follow `dashboard/looker-studio/STEP_BY_STEP_TUTORIAL.md`
2. Import `sample_stock_data.csv` into Google Sheets
3. Build dashboard in Looker Studio (takes ~30 minutes)

**If Looker Studio is done and I want real data:**
1. Sign up for FMP API (free tier: 250 calls/day)
2. Set up n8n workflow for automated data pipeline
3. Connect to Google Sheets for daily refresh

**If I want to skip to custom web app:**
1. Set up Next.js project
2. Build full-featured dashboard with sliders, modals, etc.
